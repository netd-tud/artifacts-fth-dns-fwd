# Reproduction of paper artifacts

## Requirements
 - OS: Linux, tested under Ubuntu 22.04 
 - 32 GB of RAM
 - 50 GB free disk space

## How to reproduce the artifacts
Clone this repository, then: 
1. Make sure python 3.10 is installed.
2. Make a virtual environment: `make python_env`
3. Activate python env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. To get a clean starting environment run `make clean` first.

Now you can reproduce the paper plots with: 

5. `make plots`

The plots are then stored under `reports/figures/`

To reproduce the paper tables you can simply run:

6. `make tables`

This command runs the jupyter notebook `notebooks/tables.ipynb` and creates the `notebooks/tables.html` file which contains all the tables from the paper.

### To reproduce the DNS scanning data

To run the DNS scans you need to do some set up.
Therefore copy & edit the template file.

1. ```cp scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/scanner/udp/config.yml.template scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/scanner/udp/config.yml && vim scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/scanner/udp/config.yml```

2. Fill in the missing variables:

    1. Name and IP-address of the interface the scanner will be running on.
    2. A domain used during scan. The authoritative nameserver of this domain, must be set up to reply with the two A records: IP-address of requesting DNS client on the nameserver; an IP as control record (which is currently hardcoded to `91.216.216.216` in the postprocessing)

3. ```cd scan && ./run_scan.sh udp```

#### Periodic scans:

#### DNSSEC & ANY:

#### Ratelimit Tests:

#### (Lab Setup?):

## Cleaning the environment
- `make clean` to remove figures and the table.html file.
