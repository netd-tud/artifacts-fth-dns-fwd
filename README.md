# Reproduction of paper artifacts

## Requirements for creating the figures and tables shown in the paper
 - OS: Linux, tested under Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
 - 32 GB of RAM
 - 50 GB free disk space
 - Python 3.10

## Additional requirements for performing Internet-wide scans
- An authoritative nameserver under your control
- A domain name under your control
- GOLANG 1.23.0
- ZGrab2 for fingerprinting
- Optional, but highly recommended: A scan server with no upstream filters, allowing for fast Internet-wide scans.

## How to reproduce the artifacts
Clone this repository, then: 
1. Make sure python 3.10 is installed.
2. Make a virtual environment: `make python_env`
3. Activate python env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. To get a clean starting environment run `make clean` first.

Now you can reproduce the paper plots with: 

5. `make plots`

The plots are then stored under `reports/figures/`

To reproduce the paper tables you can simply run:

6. `make tables`

This command runs the jupyter notebook `notebooks/tables.ipynb` and creates the `notebooks/tables.html` file which contains all the tables from the paper.

### To reproduce the DNS scanning data

To run the DNS scans you need to do some set up.
Copy and edit the template file:

1. ```cp scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/scanner/udp/config.yml.template scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/scanner/udp/config.yml && vim scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/scanner/udp/config.yml```

2. Fill in the missing variables:

    1. Name and IP-address of the interface the scanner will be running on.
    2. A domain used during scan. The authoritative nameserver of this domain, must be set up to reply with the two A records: IP-address of requesting DNS client on the nameserver; an IP as control record (which is currently hardcoded to `91.216.216.216` in the postprocessing)

3. ```cd scan && ./run_scan.sh udp``` (Note: This performs an Internet-wide scan for open DNS components!)

### Testing for DNSSEC and ANY query support

### Rate-limit tests
This component allows for rate limit and performance testing of DNS resolvers.
A specialized configuration and input file is required to run the tests.
The configuration template is located under ` src/ratelimit/config.yml.template`.
Please refer to [config.go](scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/config/config.go) for an explanation of each parameter that can be adjusted.

**To run the rate limit testing:**\
The input file needs to be in a .csv.gz format, containing two columns: `ip_request` and `ip_response`.
The header needs to be present in the input file.
`ip_request` will be used as target IPs for the rate limit testing while they are grouped by their `ip_response` value respectively.
If `rate_response_ip_only` is set to `true` in the `config.yml` file, the `ip_response` column will be used as target addresses during the test, and the `ip_request` column can be dropped.

Either this can be done with the last UDP scan as follows:
```
cd src
sudo ratelimit/check_pub_resolvers.sh [in: last udp scan] [out: intermediate resolver scan file] [out: intersect file]
```

Or directly:
```
cd src
sudo go run dns_tool.go --mode ratelimit --config scanner/ratelimit/config.yml input.csv.gz
```

**To test the performance of a single resolver:**\
It sufficies to set the desired configuration and run the following:
```
cd src
sudo go run dns_tool.go --mode ratelimit --config scanner/ratelimit/config.yml <1.2.3.4>
```

Results will be in `ratelimit_results/<timestamp>_<config-settings>/`

### Fingerprinting
Fingerprinting of device vendor and model may be performed for ODNS components.
Please read the instructions for [fingerprinting](scan/odns-measurement-tools/src/fingerprinting/README.md).

## Cleaning the environment
- `make clean` to remove figures and the table.html file.
