# Reproduction of paper artifacts

## Requirements
 - OS: Linux, tested under Ubuntu 22.04 
 - 32 GB of RAM
 - 50 GB free disk space

## How to reproduce the artifacts
Clone this repository, then: 
1. Make sure python 3.10 is installed.
2. Make a virtual environment: `make python_env`
3. Activate python env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
8. To get a clean starting environment run `make clean` first.

Now you can reproduce the paper plots with: 

9. `make plots`

The plots are then stored under `reports/figures/`

To reproduce the paper tables you can simply run:

10. `make tables`

This command runs the jupyter notebook `notebooks/tables.ipynb` and creates the `notebooks/tables.html` file which contains all the tables from the paper.

## Cleaning the environment
- `make clean` to remove figures and the table.html file.
